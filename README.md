# Introduction to Machine Learning (DSC3006)
Assignments and project in Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2018)

## 1. Assignments

### 1. Assignment 1: Kaggle InClass Competition

  * Goal  
  The goal of assignment 1 is to practice data preprocessing and classification through a Kaggle InClass Competition. You are expected to understand how Kaggle works and how you can improve your classification modelâ€™s performance.
  
  * Task  
  You are provided with a classification dataset and your task is to build a series of models with the goal of improving the performance. You can use any data preprocessing technique and classification method.

  * Data description
    * A detailed description is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance.
    * The dataset used in the assignment 1 is a slightly modified version with 30 features and 1 categorical target variable. The goal is to use the 30 features and classify each student into one of the FIVE categories.
      * X_train.csv: 264 samples, 30 features (Id should not be counted as a feature)
      * y_train.csv: 264 samples, 1 target (from 1 to 5, each number represents a category)
      * X_test.csv: 131 samples, 30 features (the dataset you test your model)

### 2. Assignment 2: Ensemble Learning

  * Goal  
    The goal of assignment 2 is to practice ensemble learning.
  
  * Task
    * Load the breast cancer wisconsin dataset from sklearn.
      ```
      from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
      data = load_breast_cancer()
      ```
    
    * Perform 5-fold cross validation, bagging and boosting.
    * Visualize the result.
    * Compare each methods.

## 2. Project: Lego Set Price Prediction (Multiple Linear Regressions & Neural Network)

  ### 1. Introduction

  #### Kidults
  
  * Kidults refers to grown-ups who still are consumers of toys.
  * Kidult culture is rising as well as their power in the market.
  * A marketing survey designed by myself to measure the kidults' satisfaction level on Lego's marketing efforts(product, price, place and promotion) had been conducted. 
  
  #### Survey Result

  * Respondents' level of satisfaction on the product was quite fair given other areas and the average.
  * However, they expressed a strong dissatisfaction on price-related marketing efforts of Lego with the score of 2.3 out of 5, which is notably lower than the average score of 3.17.
  * This implies the gap between the *percerived value* and *the price*, probably caused by some *outliers* or unreasonably priced product set.

  #### The Goal of the Project
  Decrease the gap between the *percerived value* and *the price* by creating a model that is not or less affected by *outliers*.
